# Stroke Prediction and Analysis

## Introduction:
This project revolves around analyzing and predicting strokes based on various demographic and health factors. 
A stroke, a serious medical condition, occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, leading to cell death. 
There are two primary types of strokes: ischemic and hemorrhagic, each with distinct causes and symptoms. 
Understanding the risk factors and early signs of stroke is crucial for timely intervention and prevention.

## Dataset Source:
This dataset is from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jillanisofttech/brain-stroke-dataset/data
The dataset used in this project contains information on individuals' demographic details, lifestyle factors, and medical history. 
Attributes include gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, occupation, residence type, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and whether the individual had a stroke or not. 

## Analysis and Visualization:
The project begins with exploratory data analysis, visualizing the distribution of stroke occurrences among different demographic groups. 
Visualizations include plots depicting the number of stroke cases, gender distribution with respect to stroke occurrence, prevalence of stroke among individuals with hypertension, and the relationship between smoking status and stroke incidence.

## Predictive Modeling:
A logistic regression model is implemented to predict the likelihood of stroke based on the provided attributes. The model achieves an accuracy score of 0.9458, indicating its effectiveness in identifying individuals at risk of stroke.
